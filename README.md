# Learning React ( Task Tracker )

This repository was done alongside an online tutorial  [https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8](https://youtu.be/w7ejDZ8SWv8)

This was to introduce myself to React and learn more uses of JS

Run the 'server' with 'npm run server'. Then, on another terminal, you can 'npm run build' and then 'serve -s build' to run the program.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `serve -s build`

Runs the build made from `npm run build`
